// why not simple sieve why ??

//  beacuase sometimes the range diff <=10^6  but they are L <R<10^12

//   you need arr of size of N stores from 1 .. oto N but now ??
//  make same but shift the things

// in the simple sieve we take prime number marks all its multiple

// in this scenrio what heppens whenever i start from L that can be prime or not

// algo

// 1.  generate al  prime numbers from 2 to sqrt(R)  // these will start my marking

// start marking in  shifting array but these numebrs
// then you can easily calculate it

// p as prime start from p*p stop <=R
